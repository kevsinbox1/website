      <h3 class="media-heading">Football</h3>
        <p>I've been passionate about football all my life, whether it's watching, playing or even dreaming about it.</p>
        <p>I'm a massive West Bromwich Albion fan and attend as many games as possible or find alternative ways of watching the game. I've had several season tickets and travelled as far away as Newcastle to watch the Baggies (5 hours on a coach!).</p>
        <p>I played football from a very young age and grew up playing for a few Sunday league teams, school teams and my university team.</P>
        <p>Football helped teach me about team work and how each person was an important part of achieving success. I also captained one of my teams which gave me an opportunity to develop my leadership skills.</P>
        <p>Whilst playing football at university I suffered my first serious injury which involved snapping my Anterior Cruciate knee ligament. It took several years to be diagnosed and I have only played a few competitive games since. </p>

      <h3 class="media-heading">Business</h3>    
  <p>I grew up wanting to be a Footballer, but when that dream died down (it still exists somewhere inside me) I decided I wanted to go into business.</p>
  <p>I love the prospect of making the decisions to grow an empire and doing things my own way. I've found myself looking up the hierarchy several times and thinking how differently I’d go about things. By starting at the bottom I can understand the frustration of employees in different situations. I aim to build an organisation where an employee looks forward to coming to work and is highly motivated to achieve their goals.</p>
  <p>I've had a few small idea's but nothing that I'm ready to take the ultimate plunge with yet. I have gained experience in two small companies and seen how to take a company from nothing (with little money) and turn it into something. Taking confidence with my past experiences I’m waiting for my opportunity to one day go it alone.</P>

      <h3 class="media-heading">Marketing</h3>  
  <p>Most my full time career has been involved in marketing, mainly digital. I am fully aware of what it takes to take a website from nothing to having a wide range of different traffic sources.</p>
  <p>I have accumulated large amount of knowledge in Search Engine Optimisation, Social Networks, Video Marketing, Google Analytics and Paid advertising such as Google AdWords.</p>

      <h3 class="media-heading">Golf</h3>
  <p>Golf is a new hobby of mine, but something I'm looking to get into during the next few years. I'm starting to learn the basics and have started seeing improvements in my game.</p>

      <h3 class="media-heading">Poker</h3>
  <p>Poker is a fascinating game, if you study it properly it heavily involves mathematics and psychology. Certain skills are excellent to apply to business situations and helping to decide when to make certain moves. When making judgements during negotiations, you need to be able to judge how close a person is to committing or how far you are to pushing them away. Making calculations on the spot in pressured situations can help you to come out with the best deals.</p>
  <p>Poker also teaches a little about managing your finances as you make investments based on returns. If you invest too much on a gamble you could make big losses.</p>

      <h3 class="media-heading">Technology</h3>
  <p>I'm a big fan of technology and always look to purchasing new things that can help make my life a little easier and more fun.</p>
  <p>My latest tech adventure involved building a computer, I had to stand back when switching it on but thankfully it worked!</p>
