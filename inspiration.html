  <p>My mother and father brought me into the world and kept me in healthy and stable environment nearly all my life. They provided me the things I needed to make my life enjoyable but without spoiling me. Instead they set goals and achievements with rewards to help encourage my personal development.</p>
  <p>My childhood was built on love and spending time together as a family. This is the best environment for a child to grow.</P>
  <p>Sadly my farther passed away when I was 17 from cancer, this was a difficult point in my life. He is the motivation behind my hard work as I want to make him proud and support the rest of my family.</p>

      <div class="panel-body">
  <p>A popular figure in the business world, the straight talking Lord Sugar is a rags to riches story. He keeps business simple and likes straight talking people.</p>
  <p>He wasn't afraid to start trading even at an early age, he took gambles in area's that had massive potential but came with high risk. His savvy business skills have made him a multimillionaire and the star of his own TV show.</p>

  Nev Whilshire
   </a>
      </h4>
    </div>
     <div id="collapseThree" class="panel-collapse collapse" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="headingThree">
      <div class="panel-body">
  <p>A recent inspiration that has been added to the list, Nev Whilshire is the star of BBC's The Call Centre and the CEO of the save money group.</p>
  <p>His unique style has been called into question by many. I for one see a fantastic manager who takes a demoralising job and makes it bearable. He makes the effort to get to know all his staff and encourages them to get involved in certain activities.</p>
  <p>He also tries to give people a chance and help give them the confidence to deliver. He's taken many employee's who would be lost elsewhere and given them opportunity’s to shine. This method would help with an employees drive and loyalty as they'd strive to pay back the employee.</p>
  <p>Although maybe some play acting for the cameras I believe he wants people to come to work and have fun. I believe people don't want to spend the majority of their life going to work in a miserable place. It can take little effort and low cost to do something enjoyable within the office and boost morale.</p>

  <p>One of the main guys behind innocent drinks which is one of my favourite brands. He worked together with two other guys to develop the healthy fruit smoothie Innocent. After developing a fun brand and growing the business in a highly competitive environment, he continues to give back with investment in other businesses.</p>

    </div>
    <div id="collapseFive" class="panel-collapse collapse" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="headingFive">
      <div class="panel-body">
  <p>Being an avid West Brom fan I have followed the club since I can remember, Paul Thompson (Chairman at the time) pulled off an smart business decision that transformed the club.</p>
  <p>West Brom were stuck in the lower end of Division 1 (currently The Championship) and we were nearly relegated at the end of the 1999/2000 season.</P> 
  <p>With a low budget and dwindling attendances, there was nothing to get excited about as a fan. The club decided to reduce season ticket prices for children to £24 per season (£1 per game). This made the family experience affordable and encouraged more people to go. This helped fill up the ground and in turn pumped up the atmosphere. With the added decibels of noise and increased backing of the players, performances improved and the fans drove the players on to the playoffs.</p>
  <p>We didn't get promoted that season however but the season ticket prices for next season remained the same. Now that the team were performing better, the levels of optimism increased leading to increased revenue and more investment was made into the team. We then went on to achieve promotion that season.</p>
  <p>That moment I believe was of great importance in the rise of West Bromwich Albion F.C over the last decade and a half. It was a top level business decision made with psychology in mind which transformed the success of the club.</P>
